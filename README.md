# MovieLandscape - An Interactive Movie Recommender System Using a 3D Landscape
In a world where, in most cases, we do not have access to interactive methods to control recommender systems that we encounter in our daily lives, I present the MovieLandscape!

This web application shows how a map metaphor can be used to make recommender systems more transparent and increase the level of control that users can exercise.
